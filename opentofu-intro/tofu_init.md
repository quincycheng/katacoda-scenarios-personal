The `tofu init` command initializes a working directory containing OpenTofu configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new OpenTofu configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.


Usage: `tofu apply [options] [plan file]`

To init the environment, execute:

```
tofu init
```{{execute}}
